I love getting out, being active, and meeting new people, but when the times right, I also love showing off my inner geekiness. Some of my favorite hobbies include, playing various sports, reading anything and everything, playing both board games and video games, and keeping up with fashion. If any of this sounds like something interesting to you, we might just have a thing or two in common."}
